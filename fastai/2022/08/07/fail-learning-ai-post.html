<p>I told you, you had the wrong guy. Anyway, I’ll try to answer.</p>

<p>Internet is a fantastic place, you are plugged into a reality where you can learn whatever you want, whenever you want and at you pace.</p>

<p>What I didn’t find yet - on web2.0 - is <strong>how to fail</strong>. How to fail programmatically, periodically and frequently. As you can image, I failed a lot and <strong>hope to keep failing at high rate</strong>.</p>

<p>For me, failing is the essence of learning, the essence of success. The Lhumann’s indicator <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> of productivity was permanent notes produced per day. The Bottoni’s indicator <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> of success is a simple counter of failings: greater the better.</p>

<p>Everything started long time ago, maybe 6 years ago. I was trying to learning Machine Learning the old way:</p>
<ol>
  <li>collected all theoretical books;</li>
  <li>collected all theoretical courses;</li>
  <li>started the journey;</li>
  <li>felt uncomfortable;</li>
  <li>stopped;</li>
  <li>and repeat the process with a slightly different theoretical book and course.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s guided me here.</p>

<p><strong>5 months ago I restarted again</strong>. The approach to Machine Learning was gradually different and this seems to be very efficient and effective.</p>

<p>I followed <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">FastAI course</a>. In one week I completed all lectures and developed a simple system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a box classifier which identified the kind of box with an accuracy of 97%;</li>
  <li>a web app, which took a picture, sent it to the model and showed the result;</li>
  <li>everything deployed in test environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope to show it as soon as my current company will make it possible.</p>

<p>It was funny, I accomplished more in that week then in 6 years of try and fail. <strong>But everything died again</strong>.</p>

<p>I got overwhelmed at work. It pushed me to say goodbye to Machine Learning. Another KO.
You know, when something really interesting you, one day you succeed. <strong>That day is not today</strong>.</p>

<p>After other 5 months, today, I’m back to the mean. To the normality <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. I understood that life is not easy and is not linear.
At the time I’m writing both my sons got Covid19, high fever, zero sleep.
I understood to embrace those things, the gifts that life give to us <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I’m ready to start again, from chapter 0.</p>

<h2 id="whats-my-next-step">
<a class="anchor" href="#whats-my-next-step" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What’s my next step?</h2>
<p>I restarted ML journey and I’m happy.</p>

<p>During those years full of failures, I sharpened my skills, where I improved a lot, I think.
From note taking to programming. From learning to memorizing. All is summarized in: be more dynamic and less static.</p>

<p>Let me pretend, for a moment, that I will accomplish the following steps.</p>

<p>To be able to mastering Machine Learning with FastAI approach I need to be a practitioner. To be a practitioner a have to do lots practice. To do lots practice a have to spend extra hours. To be able to spend extra hours I have to be motivated. To be motivated I have to be persistent. To be persistent I have to enjoy it.</p>

<p>That’s the chaining rule of the heaven.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I listen to everything on 1x speed. I admire all you folks that do 1.5x or 2x, but my brain needs time to process the ideas. Sometimes I pause the podcast/audiobook &amp; just reflect on a single sentence for a while. I used to think I need to improve this but now I just accept it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m happy to read this from <a href="https://twitter.com/lexfridman/status/1555957433578790915">Lex Fridman</a>. It means I have to watch Jeremy at 0.5x divided by few tens speed.</p>

<p>The approach to learning, as said before, seems working. So that’s what I’ll do:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Review last notes, if there’s something</li>
  <li>Watch lecture, first iteration. All in one breath</li>
  <li>Watch lecture, second iteration. Pausing as needed, experimenting, exploring and building (lots of -ing)</li>
  <li>Going through FastAI book, kaggle notes and random links <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>Do questionnaire and find weakness</li>
  <li>Focus on a project, only one. Do it well</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s wonderful approach doesn’t come from my neurons but are suggested by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58213068-meta-learning">Radek Osmulski’s book</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg">Jeremy Howard tips</a>. <strong>Yes, it’s strange, I bought a book. I’m not used to</strong>.</p>

<p>Additional and personal trick to force me studying is <strong>live streaming my session study</strong>. <strong>Embarrassing</strong> and funny moment will face.</p>

<p><strong>Deadline:</strong> end of August 2022.</p>

<p><strong>I can infinitely try to learn ML and get a finite result, as per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes">Zeno’s Paradox</a>.</strong></p>

<p>I’ll keep you updated.</p>

<p>Now let’s start. <strong>Again</strong>.</p>

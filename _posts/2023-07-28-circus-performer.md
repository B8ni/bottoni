title: Be Like a Circus Performer
---

Running a startup successfully often requires adopting the mindset of a circus performer. Imagine everyone coming to watch a show, where the same performer who wows the audience with a somersault is the one who took your ticket and ushered you to your seat.

In the world of startups and business-building, being a generalist is often the best approach, if not the only road to success.

If the term "generalist" doesn't resonate with you, think of yourself as a versatile circus performer.

Embrace the idea of tearing up the ticket, giving a stellar performance, and then dismantling your gym equipment (i.e., continuously refining your skills).

Currently, I'm in the phase of delivering my performance with the startup.
